# Graphy v1

![Graphy Logo](./logo.png)

Graphy v1 is a real-time GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application that leverages the power of [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/), [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/), and OpenAI's GPT models to extract knowledge from documents and enable natural language querying over a graph database.

## Overview

Graphy v1 allows users to upload a PDF document, which is then processed to extract entities and relationships using OpenAI's GPT models (e.g., `gpt-4o` and `text-ada-002`). The extracted information is stored in a Neo4j graph database. Users can then interact with the graph in real-time by asking natural language questions, which are converted into Cypher queries to retrieve answers from the graph.

## Features

- **Real-time GraphRAG**: Extracts knowledge from documents and allows real-time querying.
- **Modular and Configurable**: Users can set their own credentials for OpenAI and Neo4j.
- **Natural Language Interface**: Ask questions in plain English and get answers from the graph database.
- **Visualization**: (Coming Soon) Visual representation of the graph and query results.
- **Extensible**: Designed to support multiple documents and more conversational interactions in future versions.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- A Neo4j database instance (local or remote)
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graphy-v1.git
   cd graphy-v1
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

   Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Set Up Credentials**

   - Place your Groq API key and Neo4j credentials in a `.env` file or enter them directly in the app's sidebar when running.

   Example `.env` file:

   ```env
   GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
   NEO4J_URL=neo4j+s://your-neo4j-url
   NEO4J_USERNAME=your-username
   NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-password
   ```

2. **Run the App**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Interact with the App**

   - Upload a PDF file using the file uploader.
   - Once the document is processed, ask questions in the provided text input field.
   - View the generated Cypher query and the answer retrieved from the graph.
